description: Create a complete text-based fantasy RPG application using Quarkus backend, Vaadin server-side UI, and LangChain4j agents. The game features dynamic AI-driven storytelling, NPC interactions, fully autonomous team members, and simple stat-based combat where all narrative and behaviors are generated by specialized AI agents using interchangeable LLM providers (OpenAI/Ollama). NPC memories are maintained in-memory with future JOOQ persistence support.
